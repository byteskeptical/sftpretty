sftpretty
=========

A pretty quick and simple interface to paramiko SFTP. Provides multi-threaded
routines with progress notifications for reliable, asynchronous transfers. This
is a Python3 optimized fork of pysftp with additional features & improvements.

* Built-in retry decorator
* Hash function for integrity checking
* Improved local & remote directory mapping
* Improved logging mechanism
* More tests
* Multi-threaded directory transfers
* Progress notifications
* Support for ciphers, digests, kex & key type connection options
* Support for ED25519 & ECDSA keys
* Support for private key passwords
* Thread-safe connection manager


Example
-------
.. code-block:: python

    from sftpretty import Connection


    # Basic

    with Connection('hostname', username='me', password='secret') as sftp:
        # Temporarily chdir to public/.
        with sftp.cd('public'):
            # Upload file to public/ on remote.
            sftp.put('/my/local/filename')
            # Download a remote file from public/.
            sftp.get('remote_file')


    with Connection('hostname', private_key='~/.ssh/id_ed25519',
                                private_key_pass='secret') as sftp:
        # Upload local directory to remote_directory.
        sftp.put_d('/my/local', '/remote_directory')

        # Recursively download a remote_directory and save it to /tmp locally.
        sftp.get_r('remote_directory', '/tmp')


    # Advanced

    with Connection('hostname', username='me', password='secret') as sftp:
        # Upload local directory to remote_directory. On occurance of any
        # exception or child of, passed in the tuple, retry the operation.
        # Between each attempt increment a pause equal to backoff * delay.
        # Run a total of tries (six) times including the first attempt.
        sftp.put_d('/my/local', '/remote_directory',
                   exceptions=(NoValidConnectionsError,
                               socket.timeout,
                               SSHException),
                   tries=6, backoff=2, delay=1)


    with Connection('hostname', private_key='~/.ssh/id_ed25519',
                                private_key_pass='secret') as sftp:
        # Recursively download a remote_directory and save it to /tmp locally.
        # Don't confirm files, useful in a scenario where the server removes
        # the remote file immediately after download. Preserve remote mtime on
        # local copy
        sftp.get_r('remote_directory', '/tmp', confirm=False,
                   preserve_mtime=True)
